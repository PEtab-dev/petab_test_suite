# PEtab test case 0006

## Objective 

This case tests support for observable transformations (lin, log, log10).

The model is to be simulated for a single experimental condition. Measurements
for one observable are to be used as is, measurements for the two others are
to be transformed.

## Model

A simple conversion reaction `A <=> B` in a single compartment, following
mass action kinetics.
