# PEtab test case 0007

## Objective 

This case tests support for observable transformations (lin, log, log10).

The model is to be simulated for a single experimental condition. Measurements
for observable `obs_a` are to be used as is, measurements for `obs_b` and `obs_c`
are to be transformed for computing chi2 and likelihood.

## Model

A simple conversion reaction `A <=> B` in a single compartment, following
mass action kinetics.
