# PEtab test case 0008

## Objective 

This case tests support for replicate measurements.

The model is to be simulated for a single experimental condition. The single
model output has multiple measurements for the same condition and timepoint.

## Model

A simple conversion reaction `A <=> B` in a single compartment, following
mass action kinetics.
