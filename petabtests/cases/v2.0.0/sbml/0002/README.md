# PEtab test case 0002

## Objective

This case tests support for multiple simulation conditions

The model is to be simulated for two different experimental conditions
(here: different initial concentrations).

Some values are overridden in the parameter table by numeric values.

## Model

A simple conversion reaction `A <=> B` in a single compartment, following
mass action kinetics.
