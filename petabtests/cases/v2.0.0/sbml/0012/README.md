# PEtab test case 0012

## Objective

This case tests initial compartment sizes in the condition table.

Note that changing the compartment size will only change the compartment size
itself. It will not change the concentration of concentration-based species
therein.

## Model

A simple conversion reaction `A <=> B` in a single compartment, following
mass action kinetics.
